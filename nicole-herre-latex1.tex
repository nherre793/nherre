During Calculus I, I thought I fully understood limits. I knew how to evaluate the limit of a function as it converged to a specific point. However, it was not until Calculus II that I realized I did not know how to compute the limit of a function as it approached a point specifically from the right or left. 




Moreover, I had a poor understanding of how to evaluate the limit of a function as it approached infinity. I quickly had to learn how to work with equations involving infinity. Though it seems obvious now, it initially took much careful consideration to come to the conclusion, for example, that an integer divided by infinity would be 0, as the fraction would become infinitely small. 




At first, it took some critical thinking to learn how to work with these cases of limits. However, after much practice, it has become a familiar concept.
